Links and instructions for running LDD on your Raspberry Pi.
1. Install Wine on your Raspberry Pi using [Pi-Apps](https://github.com/Botspot/pi-apps).
2. [Download LDD version 4.3.11](https://web.archive.org/web/20190622153357/https://lc-www-live-s.legocdn.com/downloads/ldd2.0/installer/setupLDD-PC-4_3_11.exe), not 4.3.12. For some reason, Lego Digital Designer v4.3.12 is missing most of the blocks. See [here](https://bricks.stackexchange.com/questions/12715) for more details.
3. Install the exe with Wine.
